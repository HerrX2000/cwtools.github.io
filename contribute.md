# Contribute

CWTools is for the community (thanks to Dayshine here ðŸ™‚). If you want to help the project, you are invited to contribute. You can help with adding support for new cw games, update existing support for game or help improve the experience with the addon.

## Found a bug?

Create an issue [here >](https://github.com/cwtools/cwtools-vscode/issues) or for the specific [game](./projects) and describe the problem you have encountered.

## Helpful skills

Contributing is much easier then you might think. Only a handful of helpful skills are recommended.

* Basic programming knowledge to faster understand how the tools works
* Basic knowledge of Git is useful to share your code with us

## Help with a specific game

1. Choose what [game](./projects) you want to contribute to
2. Clone the repository to a filepath, e.g. D:\Git\cwtools-ck3-config or copy the contents of the zip you can download. *Pro Tip: Fork the repo*
3. Open VS Code, and go to File, Preferences, Settings
    1. (Optional) To make the changes only apply to this folder (not all folders on your computer), change the tab at the top to "workspace settings"
4. Set "cwtools.rules_version" to "manual"
5. Set "cwtools.rules_folder" to the path above. e.g. D:\Git\cwtools-ck3-config
6. Re-open VS Code. Now you are using the rules you have copied also know as cloning to your computer.
7. Open 1.30 vanilla in one window or your mod, open the rules folder in another window.
8. Add/change rules that are defined in e.g. D:\Git\cwtools-ck3-config.
9. Once you make changes to the rules, you can press "Ctrl-shift-p" and select "Reload window" to easily restart the extension.
10. Confirm errors are reduced, return to step 8.
